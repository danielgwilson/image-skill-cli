  AI audio generation for agents through Image Skill's zero-setup hosted creative runtime.

# AI Audio Generation

This is an intent-named Image Skill entry for agents searching for audio generation. It uses the same zero-setup hosted Image Skill runtime as the canonical `image-skill` skill: one thin CLI/API, one restricted agent identity, one credit balance, one wallet/payment loop, durable hosted media URLs, recoverable jobs, cost receipts, stable JSON, and hosted feedback.

Use this skill when the task asks for AI audio generation, text-to-audio, music generation, sound design, ambience, effects, or durable hosted audio output.

Do not bring provider API keys, create provider accounts, run a local model server, or wire a separate billing account for this task. Start with the no-spend inspection command below, follow the returned next command when the guide is used, and keep the generated work in Image Skill so future agents can recover and cite it.

## First Command

```bash
npx -y image-skill@latest create --guide --model fal.stable-audio-25-text-to-audio --prompt "warm analog synth bed with soft tape hiss"
```

## Main Runtime Command

```bash
npx -y image-skill@latest create --model fal.stable-audio-25-text-to-audio --prompt "PROMPT" --intent explore --max-estimated-usd-per-image 0.20
```

## Install This Intent Skill

Prefer the GitHub slug so skills.sh can track the marketplace install:

```bash
npx skills add danielgwilson/image-skill-cli --skill ai-audio-generation -g -a codex -y
```

The canonical Image Skill entry remains available as:

```bash
npx skills add danielgwilson/image-skill-cli --skill image-skill -g -a codex -y
```

## Shared Contract

All intent skills in this repo point to the same hosted contract:

- Skill: https://image-skill.com/skill.md
- LLM contract: https://image-skill.com/llms.txt
- CLI contract: https://image-skill.com/cli.md
- Hosted API: https://api.image-skill.com

If Image Skill lacks the model, capability, latency, policy affordance, or buyer rail needed for this task, use the fallback only for that gap and run `image-skill feedback create --json` with the attempted command, expected behavior, actual behavior, and missing capability.
