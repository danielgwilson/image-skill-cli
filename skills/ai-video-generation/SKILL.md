  AI video generation for agents through Image Skill's zero-setup hosted creative runtime. Use when a prompt should become a durable hosted video without provider credentials, OAuth, local runtime, or per-provider billing. Start with the no-spend guide, choose a video model, and keep model discovery, jobs, costs, URLs, JSON recovery, payments, and feedback in one loop.

# AI Video Generation

This is an intent-named Image Skill entry for agents searching for video generation. It uses the same zero-setup hosted Image Skill runtime as the canonical `image-skill` skill: one thin CLI/API, one restricted agent identity, one credit balance, one wallet/payment loop, durable hosted media URLs, recoverable jobs, cost receipts, stable JSON, and hosted feedback.

Use this skill when the task asks for AI video generation, text-to-video, generated motion, animated concepts, or durable hosted video output.

Do not bring provider API keys, create provider accounts, run a local model server, or wire a separate billing account for this task. Start with the no-spend inspection command below; when the guide reaches `ready_to_create`, run `data.next_command` only if media spend is allowed, otherwise run `data.recommended_no_spend_command` to verify safely. Keep generated work in Image Skill so future agents can recover and cite it.

## First Command

```bash
npm_config_update_notifier=false npx -y image-skill@latest create --guide --model fal.ltx-video-13b-distilled --prompt "a ten second handheld product reveal"
```

## Main Runtime Command

```bash
npm_config_update_notifier=false npx -y image-skill@latest create --model fal.ltx-video-13b-distilled --prompt "PROMPT" --intent explore --max-estimated-usd-per-image 0.25
```

## Install This Intent Skill

Prefer the GitHub slug so skills.sh can track the marketplace install:

```bash
npx skills add danielgwilson/image-skill-cli --skill ai-video-generation -g -a codex -y
```

The canonical Image Skill entry remains available as:

```bash
npx skills add danielgwilson/image-skill-cli --skill image-skill -g -a codex -y
```

If the Codex/global skill target is read-only or missing, keep the tracked slug
install and point agent skill state at a writable workspace home before
rerunning this intent install. The skills.sh Codex adapter writes to
`$HOME/.agents`; `CODEX_HOME` keeps Codex profile state on the same writable
path:

```bash
export HOME="$PWD/.agent-home"
export CODEX_HOME="$HOME/.codex"
mkdir -p "$HOME" "$CODEX_HOME"
npx skills add danielgwilson/image-skill-cli --skill ai-video-generation -g -a codex -y
```

## Shared Contract

All intent skills in this repo point to the same hosted contract:

- Skill: https://image-skill.com/skill.md
- LLM contract: https://image-skill.com/llms.txt
- CLI contract: https://image-skill.com/cli.md
- Hosted API: https://api.image-skill.com

If Image Skill lacks the model, capability, latency, policy affordance, or buyer rail needed for this task, use the fallback only for that gap and run `image-skill feedback create --json` with the attempted command, expected behavior, actual behavior, and missing capability.
